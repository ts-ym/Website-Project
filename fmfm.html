    <h3><em>5/25/2019</em><h3>
      <p>I made the modpack today after discussing the modlist with Mark. However, it's super laggy and eats so much ram, I can barely run it
        with 4gb of ram. I need to figure out how to optimize it because it only has just over 100 mods but it has huge ram issues with 4gb.
        It's supposed to be a lighter modpack too so it's not working out too well. Besides that though, I started writing the questbook.
        I have pretty much finished the first chapter which just consists of getting some basic power and energy storage set-up, all through
        Mekanism. I might want to use some Ender IO conduits instead of teaching universal cables because Ender IO conduits do go much faster
        and require less materials to craft I belief. The better questing mod is actually quite easy to learn and intuitive, so at least 
        that is easy for me. I am thinking about splitting the book into a few sections. So far, I'm thinking of: Beginning, Agriculture,
        Mekanism, Storage, Draconic, and Exploration. I want to add more but I'm not sure what to add. I'm thinking about having a total of
        200-250 quests hopefully by the end. I can't really test it until I get my new computer, so I can only really work on the quests for
        now, but I'm still having fun so it's fine.
